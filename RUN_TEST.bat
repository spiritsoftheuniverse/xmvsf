echo XMVSF Stage 87.157 TEST - RESTORED EARLY KEN CANCEL + ROM VERIFIED SUPERS
echo Executable: %EXE%
echo SAME BUILD, TWO DHC CHOICES:
echo   During Ryu Shinkuu Hadoken, QCF+LP+MP queues Ken SHORYUREPPA 2E00/D6722.
echo   During Ryu Shinkuu Hadoken, QCF+LK+MK queues Ken SHINRYUKEN 2E02/D6976.
echo Both ROM targets are verified and logged simultaneously in dhc_native_handoff.tsv.
echo NEW FAST MODE: Ryu's live 2E08 super uses captured 87.150 native tag at timer 8.
echo Immediately on real Ken arrival, cancel his 2A0C kick into nonattack 2A08.
echo At Ken's first confirmed 2A08 frame, enter verified Ken ROM idle and submit a short QCF+2P / QCF+2K.
echo This restores 87.150's early timing without the 2C32 dash / 2C00 Hadoken guesses.
echo Requires real Ken 2E00 or 2E02 ROM acceptance; it is not yet a fully validated DHC.
echo Native variable combination QCF+HP+HK is NEVER submitted by the test.
echo Invalid Ryu 2C04 native dispatch aborts without copying stale controller state.
echo Training menu options persist in FBNeo\config\games\xmvsfu_training_options.cfg
echo FRAME DATA: ATTACK DURATION ends on native action exit - directions, jumps, and height do not extend it.
echo Verified modes: normal 28xx, special 2Cxx, and multi-step super 2Exx.
echo Saved: hitboxes, display, meter, dizzy, damage mode, two dummy HPs, player select, frame data.
echo Super-candidate inputs print to Warcraft-style chat and fade after 3 sec.
echo Shift+G opens/closes the full chat history.
echo F10 native capture ON/OFF is acknowledged in chat and written to disk.
echo F9 replay; Shift+F10 quick-load.

echo In EARLY mode, Ken's FIRST incoming kick is suppressed as in 87.150; no second attack.
echo After fast Ken 2A08 cancel, TEST submits one QCF+2P or QCF+2K through native CPS-2 ports.
echo Native 2E00 Shoryureppa / 2E02 Shinryuken are independently verified; no host script injection.
echo All physical button inputs remain intact outside the bounded Ken native input window.
echo Ryu tag-out and super-charge streaks retained.
echo Failed input dispatch, normal super recovery and native point swap release the DHC lock.
echo EXPERIMENT: P1 Ryu-to-Ken only. Restored frame-accurate cancel using 87.150 ROM timing. Stable untouched.
